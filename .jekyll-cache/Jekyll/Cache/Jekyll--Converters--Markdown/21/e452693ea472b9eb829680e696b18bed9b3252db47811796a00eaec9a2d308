I"r<p>I have recently wrote an article on LinkedIn about Bayesâ€™ theorem and the beautiful philosophy behind it.</p>

<p>Since it is publicly available, rather than copying and pasting everything, you can read it directly <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beautiful-philosophy-behind-bayes-theorem-francesco-tamborra/">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Enjoy !</p>
