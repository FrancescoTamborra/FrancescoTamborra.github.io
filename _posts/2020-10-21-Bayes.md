I have recently wrote an article on LinkedIn about Bayes' theorem and the beautiful philosophy behind it.

Since it is publicly available, rather than copying and pasting everything, you can read it directly **[here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beautiful-philosophy-behind-bayes-theorem-francesco-tamborra/)**.

Enjoy !
